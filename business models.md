To make it profitable and sustainable, a marketplace model with tiered subscription options and transaction fees would work well. 
### 1. **Revenue Model:**
   - **Freemium Tiered Subscription Model:**
     - **Free Tier:** Allow customers to register and submit basic land details, view available consultants, and browse a limited number of profiles or portfolios.
     - **Premium Tier for Professionals (Designers, Consultants, Construction, Smart Home providers):** These users can subscribe to access premium features, such as:
       - Increased visibility in customer searches.
       - Detailed analytics (views, clicks on profiles, engagement tracking).
       - Priority notifications for new customer projects.
       - Enhanced profile options to showcase portfolios, reviews, etc.
     - **VIP Tier for Customers:** Offer a paid VIP tier where customers receive priority access to consultants and enhanced features such as faster response times, premium consultant recommendations, and dedicated customer support.

   - **Transaction/Service Fees:**
     - Charge a percentage fee for every approved quotation. This fee can be either fixed or a percentage based on the project size.
     - Implement this with a smart contract setup that handles payments between customer and consultant, releasing funds upon achieving milestones.

   - **Lead Generation Fees:**
     - If a customer selects a service provider (e.g., consultant or construction company), the app charges a lead generation fee to that provider for each customer connection or conversion.

### 2. **Key Features to Drive Value:**
   - **Matching Algorithm:** Enhance customer satisfaction and app engagement by recommending consultants, designers, and other professionals based on project type, budget, location, etc.
   - **In-app Chat and Document Exchange:** Streamline communication and speed up the project workflow.
   - **Progress Tracking:** Offer both customers and providers a project dashboard where they can manage stages, track milestones, and upload documents.
   - **User Reviews and Ratings:** Allow customers to rate service providers, building trust and incentivizing quality service.

### 3. **Monetization Add-ons:**
   - **Sponsored Listings for Service Providers:** Allow providers to pay for boosted listings to increase visibility.
   - **Premium Analytics Dashboard:** Offer service providers detailed insights into customer engagement with their profiles and portfolios.
   - **Vendor Collaboration:** Charge fees for integrating third-party vendors, e.g., smart home providers and building material suppliers.

### 4. **Customer Retention Strategies:**
   - **Loyalty Programs or Discounts:** Encourage returning customers by offering discounts or loyalty points for using the app across multiple stages.
   - **Partner Discounts:** Collaborate with third-party vendors to offer app-exclusive discounts on materials or smart home devices.
